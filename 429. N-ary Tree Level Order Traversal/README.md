# [429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

![narytreeexample.png](narytreeexample.png)

We should return its level order traversal:

    [
        [1],
        [3,2,4],
        [5,6]
    ]

**Note:**

1. The depth of the tree is at most `1000`.
2. The total number of nodes is at most `5000`.
