# [441. Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

You have a total of _n_ coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every _k-th_ row must have exactly _k_ coins.

Given _n_, find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be formed.

_n_ is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

    n = 5

    The coins can form the following rows:
    ¤
    ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤

    Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

**Example 2:**

    n = 8

    The coins can form the following rows:
    ¤
    ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤

    Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
