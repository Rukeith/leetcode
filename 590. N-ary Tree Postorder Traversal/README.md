# [590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

Given an n-ary tree, return the _postorder_ traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

![nary tree](narytreeexample.png)

Return its postorder traversal as: `[5,6,3,2,4,1]`.

**Note:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
