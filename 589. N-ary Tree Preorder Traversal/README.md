# [590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

Given an n-ary tree, return the _preorder_ traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

![nary tree](narytreeexample.png)

Return its preorder traversal as: `[1,3,5,6,2,4]`.

**Note:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
