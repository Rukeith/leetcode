# [821. Shortest Distance to a Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-a-character/description)
Given a string `S` and a character `C`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character `C` in the string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
```

**Note:**

1. `S` string length is in `[1, 10000]`.
2. `C` is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string `S`.
3. All letters in `S` and `C` are lowercase.
