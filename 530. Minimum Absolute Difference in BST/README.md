# [530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum [absolute difference](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Absolute_difference) between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**

    Input:

      1
        \
        3
        /
      2

    Output:
    1

    Explanation:
    The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).

**Note:** There are at least two nodes in this BST.
