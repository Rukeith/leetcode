# [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

Given two strings **_s_** and **_t_**, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in **_s_** can be replaced to get **_t_**.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

    Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
    Output: true

**Example 2:**

    Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
    Output: false

**Example 3:**

    Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
    Output: true

**Note:**  
You may assume both **_s_** and **_t_** have the same length.
