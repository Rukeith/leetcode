# [303. Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)

Given an integer array _nums_, find the sum of the elements between indices _i_ and _j_ (_i_ ? _j_), inclusive.

**Example:**
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

    sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
    sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
    sumRange(0, 5) -> -3

**Note:**

1. You may assume that the array does not change.
2. There are many calls to sumRange function.
