# [303. Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/description)
Given an integer array *nums*, find the sum of the elements between indices *i* and *j (i â‰¤ j)*, inclusive.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

**Note:**
1. You may assume that the array does not change.
2. There are many calls to sumRange function.
